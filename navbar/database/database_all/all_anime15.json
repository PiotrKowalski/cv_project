Finally, Arion and Geedo (a huge ape-like creature who had become Arion`s friend and companion) left the Underworld to find Zeus. Seneca, a small thief, makes off with Arion`s sword and this leads Arion to his first encounter with the forces of Zeus, commanded by his daughter Athena.

As Arion rejoins Geedo and Seneca (and worries about Lesfeena), the forces of Zeus and Poseidon face each other in battle.
