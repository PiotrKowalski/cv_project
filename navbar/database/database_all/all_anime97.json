Yusei and Jaden agree to pursue Paradox, which leads them to the past and causes a meeting with the King of Games, Yugi Mutou. However, by the time Yusei &amp; Jaden arrive, Paradox had already attacked his time, supposedly killing both Pegasus and Yugi's grandpa, and had also managed to steal Blue-Eyes White Dragon and Red-Eyes Black Dragon. After explaining everything to Yugi, he agrees to fight with Yusei and Jaden against Paradox in the ultimate three-on-one duel to free the trapped monsters and save both the world and time itself before it's too late.<br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "startDate": {"year": 2010, "month": 1, "day": 23}, "endDate": {"year": 2010, "month": 1, "day": 23}, "season": "WINTER", "episodes": 1, "duration": 49, "genres": ["Adventure"], "averageScore": 69, "trending": 0, "popularity": 2675, "streamingEpisodes": [], "coverImage": {"large": "https://s3.anilist.co/media/anime/cover/medium/6951.jpg", "medium": "https://s3.anilist.co/media/anime/cover/small/6951.jpg"}, "bannerImage": null, "isAdult": false, "format": "MOVIE"}, {"id": 6953, "title": {"romaji": "Ningen Doubutsuen", "english": "Human Zoo"}, "type": "ANIME", "status": "FINISHED", "description": "A story about a human zoo.", "startDate": {"year": 1962, "month": null, "day": null}, "endDate": {"year": 1962, "month": null, "day": null}, "season": null, "episodes": 1, "duration": 2, "genres": [], "averageScore": 25, "trending": 0, "popularity": 508, "streamingEpisodes": [], "coverImage": {"large": "https://s3.anilist.co/media/anime/cover/medium/6953.jpg", "medium": "https://s3.anilist.co/media/anime/cover/small/6953.jpg"}, "bannerImage": null, "isAdult": false, "format": "MOVIE"}, {"id": 6954, "title": {"romaji": "Kara no Kyoukai: Shuushou", "english": "Final Chapter: the Garden of sinners"}, "type": "ANIME", "status": "FINISHED", "description": "March, 1999: Mikiya Kokutou meets \"Shiki Ryougi\" again at the same place where he met her for the first time four years ago...\r\n<br><br>\r\n(Source: Aniplex USA)", "startDate": {"year": 2011, "month": 2, "day": 2}, "endDate": {"year": 2011, "month": 2, "day": 2}, "season": "WINTER", "episodes": 1, "duration": 33, "genres": ["Mystery", "Supernatural", "Psychological"], "averageScore": 69, "trending": 0, "popularity": 7361, "streamingEpisodes": [], "coverImage": {"large": "https://s3.anilist.co/media/anime/cover/medium/6954.jpg", "medium": "https://s3.anilist.co/media/anime/cover/small/6954.jpg"}, "bannerImage": "https://s3.anilist.co/media/anime/banner/6954-CStLfAXNsk9W.png", "isAdult": false, "format": "SPECIAL"}, {"id": 6956, "title": {"romaji": "Working!!", "english": "Wagnaria!!"}, "type": "ANIME", "status": "FINISHED", "description": "Set in a family restaurant in Hokkaido, the northern prefecture of Japan, 16-year-old high school student Souta Takanashi works part-time along with his strange co-workers: Popura Taneshima, a high school girl who's a year older than Souta, yet easily mistaken for an elementary/middle schooler, and Kyoko Shirafuji, the 28-year-old store manager who doesn't bother to do any work at all. <br><br>\n(Source: NIS America) ", "startDate": {"year": 2010, "month": 4, "day": 4}, "endDate": {"year": 2010, "month": 6, "day": 27}, "season": "SPRING", "episodes": 13, "duration": 24, "genres": ["Comedy", "Slice of Life"], "averageScore": 75, "trending": 1, "popularity": 21332, "streamingEpisodes": [{"title": "Episode 1 - Welcome to Wagnaria - Takanashi Goes to Work", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/wagnaria/episode-1-welcome-to-wagnaria-takanashi-goes-to-work-585582"}, {"title": "Episode 2 - Inami, the Androphobic...Because She's Scared", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/wagnaria/episode-2-inami-the-androphobicbecause-shes-scared-585602"}, {"title": "Episode 3 - Yachiyo and Kyoko and Sato...And, Otoo-san Returns to Us", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/wagnaria/episode-3-yachiyo-and-kyoko-and-satoand-otoo-san-returns-to-us-585604"}, {"title": "Episode 4 - Soma, the Nice...est Young Man", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/wagnaria/episode-4-soma-the-niceest-young-man-585606"}, {"title": "Episode 5 - One Windy Day, an Unusual Wagnaria", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/wagnaria/episode-5-one-windy-day-an-unusual-wagnaria-585608"}, {"title": "Episode 6 - Sota's Melancholy, the Women of Takanashi", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/wagnaria/episode-6-sotas-melancholy-the-women-of-takanashi-585610"}, {"title": "Episode 7 - Long Time No See, Otoo!
