Through a little coercing and a bit of covert activity, Mutta's family and friends can get his resume on the right desk, but from that point on it will be up to Mutta himself.

The first step on the highway to the stars is always the hardest, and in a job where crash and burn isn't just a euphemism, it will be the biggest risk Mutta's ever taken. But with the best support team ever, maybe he'll find what he needs to rekindle the spark inside him and light the biggest candle of them all! <br><br>\r\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ", "startDate": {"year": 2012, "month": 4, "day": 1}, "endDate": {"year": 2014, "month": 3, "day": 22}, "season": "SPRING", "episodes": 99, "duration": 24, "genres": ["Comedy", "Sci-Fi", "Slice of Life"], "averageScore": 83, "trending": 0, "popularity": 10247, "streamingEpisodes": [{"title": "PV 1", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/space-brothers-pv-1-594643"}, {"title": "PV 2", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/space-brothers-pv-2-594737"}, {"title": "Episode 1 - #01  Little Brother Hibito and Big Brother Mutta", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-1-01-little-brother-hibito-and-big-brother-mutta-594787"}, {"title": "Episode 2 - My Shining Star", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-2-my-shining-star-594789"}, {"title": "Episode 3 - The Man with the Advantage and the Running Female Doctor", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-3-the-man-with-the-advantage-and-the-running-female-doctor-594791"}, {"title": "Episode 4 - Next to Hibito", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-4-next-to-hibito-594793"}, {"title": "Episode 5 - Days of Missing", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-5-days-of-missing-594795"}, {"title": "Episode 6 - Et Cetera in My Head", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-6-et-cetera-in-my-head-594797"}, {"title": "Episode 7 - Dear Hibito", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-7-dear-hibito-594799"}, {"title": "Episode 8 - Smoky Heaven", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-8-smoky-heaven-594801"}, {"title": "Episode 9 - Individual Resolve", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-9-individual-resolve-594803"}, {"title": "Episode 10 - Running Bus", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-10-running-bus-594805"}, {"title": "Episode 11 - Trapped Rivals", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-11-trapped-rivals-594807"}, {"title": "Episode 12 - My Name Is Itou Serika", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-12-my-name-is-itou-serika-594809"}, {"title": "Episode 13 - 3-D Ant", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-13-3-d-ant-594811"}, {"title": "Episode 14 - Broken Glasses and the Sole of the Foot", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-14-broken-glasses-and-the-sole-of-the-foot-594813"}, {"title": "Episode 15 - Let's Talk About Space", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-15-lets-talk-about-space-594815"}, {"title": "Episode 16 - Alarm, but No Clock", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-16-alarm-but-no-clock-594817"}, {"title": "Episode 17 - The Culprit Is in the Room", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/space-brothers/episode-17-the-culprit-is-in-the-room-594819"}, {"title": "Episode 18 - Roo-ra!
