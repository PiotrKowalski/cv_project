One day, a puppet he is carving out of wood begins to speak even before he has finished shaping it. The old man names the puppet Pinocchio, and treats him as the son he never had. The puppet is dreadfully naughty and causes trouble for the old man, but his heart is in the right place and he earns Jeppet&rsquo;s love as though he were a human son. However, tragedy befalls the pair. Pinocchio is deceived by the wicked fox Dino and his sidekick, the cat Witch, while on his way to school.

Of course, there's also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines. <br><br>\nOne day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the \"BlackBird\"). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car's previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner's death. The manga follows Akio's various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority. <br><br>\n(Source: AniDB) ", "startDate": {"year": 2007, "month": 6, "day": 15}, "endDate": {"year": 2008, "month": 9, "day": 13}, "season": "SUMMER", "episodes": 26, "duration": 25, "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "averageScore": 65, "trending": 1, "popularity": 1231, "streamingEpisodes": [], "coverImage": {"large": "https://s3.anilist.co/media/anime/cover/medium/2608.jpg", "medium": "https://s3.anilist.co/media/anime/cover/small/2608.jpg"}, "bannerImage": null, "isAdult": false, "format": "TV"}, {"id": 2609, "title": {"romaji": "Kakyuusei (1999)", "english": null}, "type": "ANIME", "status": "FINISHED", "description": "When Tsuyoshi rushed to school as usual, he found a girl who tried to help a kitten which couldn't get down from a tree.
