Ash Ketchum and a group of other Pokemon Trainers are summoned by Mewtwo to have a battle with it, but they soon discover that they're only being invited so Mewtwo can clone their Pokemon for it's own purposes. Ash then tries to find a way to stop Mewtwo's plot before it can be carried out. <br><br>\n(Source: ANN)", "startDate": {"year": 1998, "month": 7, "day": 18}, "endDate": {"year": 1998, "month": 7, "day": 18}, "season": "SUMMER", "episodes": 1, "duration": 86, "genres": ["Adventure", "Comedy", "Drama", "Sci-Fi"], "averageScore": 73, "trending": 0, "popularity": 10718, "streamingEpisodes": [], "coverImage": {"large": "https://s3.anilist.co/media/anime/cover/medium/528-9seNTUWbEekU.jpg", "medium": "https://s3.anilist.co/media/anime/cover/small/528-9seNTUWbEekU.jpg"}, "bannerImage": "https://s3.anilist.co/media/anime/banner/528-8wAm08dANFi8.jpg", "isAdult": false, "format": "MOVIE"}, {"id": 529, "title": {"romaji": "Saishuu Heiki Kanojo", "english": "She, The Ultimate Weapon"}, "type": "ANIME", "status": "FINISHED", "description": "Shuuji and Chise are third year students at a high school in Hokkaido.
